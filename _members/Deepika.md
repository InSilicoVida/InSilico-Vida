My work is to develop Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Models (PBPK) and Systems Biology models for evaluating toxicity using programming language like Rstudio and Python. I have hands-on-experience in culturing the cells (in-vitro), techniques like UV-Vis, PCR, transwell permeability etc. Also I am involved in ontology development for biomedical domain, and developing or refining the adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). I am currently involved with PARC (European Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals) which consists of 200 partners in 28 countries.
Skills: PBPK Modeling · Machine Learning · Toxicology and Risk Assessment · Systems Biology/Pharmacodynamic Modeling
