*Current*
**PARC: European Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals**<br>
The objective of this project is develop next-generation chemical risk assessment in order to protect health and the environment. It is coordinated by ANSES with 200 partners in 28 countries and at EU level, national agencies and research organisations working in the areas of the environment or public health, the European Chemical Agency (ECHA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Environment Agency (EEA). It is a 7 year partnership financially co-funded by the EU “Horizon Europe” framework programme under the grant agreement No. 101057014 (2021-2027).

**MERLON: Merging scientific evidence with regulatory practices and leveraging identification of endocrine disruptors using new approach methodologies**<br>
MERLON is focused on EDCs (endocrine disruptor chemicals), and developing the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework especially quantitative AOP networks, and increase the availability of human-relevant NAMs (New Approach Methodology) to bridge the gap between science and policy needed to advance regulatory decision making and reduce health impacts of EDCs. Focused endpoint is reproductive toxicity after exposure to EDCs. The project is coordinated by Technical University of Denmark [DTU] with 10 other prominent EU institutions participating: 1) Vrije Universiteit, Netherland VUA, 2) Karolinska Institute, Sweden KI, 3) Research Institute For Environmental And Occupational Health, France IRSET, 4) The Capital Region of Denmark, Denmark REGIONH, 5) University of Lieg, Belgium ULIEGE, 6) Pere Virgili Institute for Health Research, Spain IISPV, 7) National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Netherland RIVM, 8) University of Cordoba, Spain UCO, 9) Health and Environment Alliance, Belgium HEAL, and 10) Norwegian Institute for Water Research, Norway NIVA).

*Past*

**FlameRISK: Sources, exposure and health risk to legacy and emerging Flame retardants in Spanish indoor environments. An integrated health RISK approach**<br>
The GENERAL OBJECTIVE of FlameRISK is to understand how and to what extent flame-retardants (FRs) are released from consumer products in Spanish indoor environments and to assess the human exposure and the associated health risks. The project will be focused not only on restricted FRs but also on the new emerging such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). In-silico tools (such as PBPK/PD and QSAR) and emerging non-animal techniques (such as in vitrotargeted strategies and system toxicology)
will be used to understand the
neurotoxicity mechanisms of FRs.
