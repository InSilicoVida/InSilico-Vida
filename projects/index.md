MERLON is focused on EDCs (endocrine disruptor chemicals), and developing the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework especially quantitative AOP networks, and increase the availability of human-relevant NAMs (New Approach Methodology) to bridge the gap between science and policy needed to advance regulatory decision making and reduce health impacts of EDCs. Focused endpoint is reproductive toxicity after exposure to EDCs.
